# Data Analyst: Take Home Exercise

## **Task**

In this take home exercise you will analyze two datasets containing worker data from our widget factory.

While we do not have any firm expectations on the format of your final deliverable, we would love for you to explore, analyze, visualize and interpret the provided data in ways you think could add value.

The main objective of this exercise is for us to get an understanding of the questions you ask in this process, how you go about answering them, and any insights you draw. Please provide as much context as possible on how you've gotten to your conclusions!

We’re interested in understanding your complete process, how you approach data, where your mind goes, and how you get to your conclusions!

## **Constraints**

Use whatever tools you feel most comfortable with! Day-to-day we work in SQL and Python/Jupyter notebooks, but are happy to take a look at whatever output you feel best represents your analysis.

## **Dataset Description**

You’ll find the datasets for the exercise in the files widgets.csv and workers.csv. They contains sample data meant to represent the type of data that the team deals with. Below is a description of the fields:

### **workers.csv** 
1. **`Worker ID`**: a unique identifier for each worker in the dataset.
2. **`Worker Name`**: worker name.
3. **`Hire Date`**: date worker was hired.
4. **`Worker Status`**: category of worker employement.  Values can be full time, part time, and per diem.
5. **`Team`**: team the worker is assigned to.

### **widgets.csv**

1. **`Item Number`**: identifier for each widget in the dataset.
2. **`Step 1`**: amount of time taken for this step in the widget making process.
3. **`Step 2`**: amount of time taken for this step in the widget making process.
4. **`Step 3`**: amount of time taken for this step in the widget making process.
5. **`Worker ID`**: key to worker id in the workers.csv file.

**Good luck and have fun!**
